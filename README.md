# 🚀 NeetCode 150 – DSA Preparation Journey

This repository contains my structured solutions to the **NeetCode 150** problem set.

The goal of this repo is to build strong foundations in:
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Problem-solving patterns
- Interview-level thinking

This is part of my preparation for top-tier software engineering roles (Google / Big Tech).
